title: Native Functions and Hooks
---

This page shows how to get, call and hook a native function by its address or signature.

## Get the function

### Get signature from gamedata

You can get the signature from gamedata by using `Core.Memory.GetSignatureFromGamedata` method.
Example:
```csharp
var signature = Core.GameData.GetSignature("CBaseEntity::DispatchSpawn");
```

### Get a function address by signature

To get an address by signature, you can use `Core.Memory.GetAddressBySignature` method.
Example:
```csharp
var address = Core.Memory.GetAddressBySignature(Library.Server, "55 8B EC 83 EC 08 8B 45 08 5D C3");
```

### Declaring function type delegate

Before you get an unmanaged native function, you must declare a delegate type for the function.
Example:
```csharp
[UnmanagedFunctionPointer(CallingConvention.Cdecl)]
delegate nint DispatchSpawnDelegate(nint pEntity, nint pKV);
```
This is the delegate type for `CBaseEntity::DispatchSpawn` function.

### Get function from address

You can get a memory function by using `Core.Memory.GetUnmanagedFunctionByAddress` method.
```csharp
var func = Core.Memory.GetUnmanagedFunctionByAddress<DispatchSpawnDelegate>(address);
```

### Get virtual function by vtable pointer and offset

You can get a virtual function by using `Core.Memory.GetVirtualFunctionByVTablePointerAndOffset` method.
```csharp
var func = Core.Memory.GetUnmanagedFunctionByVTable<DispatchSpawnDelegate>(*(void**)pObject, 15);
```


## Call the function

Example:
```csharp
var result = func.Call(1337, 0xDEADBEEF);
```

This example calls a function with two parameters.

With `.Call`, it will call the present function address, which might be hooked by other mods.

If you want to call the original function, you can use `.CallOriginal`.

## Hook the function

Example:
```csharp
var guid = func.AddHook((next) => {
  // You shouldn't write anything here!
  return (pEntity, pKV) => {
    // pre code
    Console.WriteLine("TestPlugin DispatchSpawn Pre");
    var result = next()(pEntity + 1, pKV); // modify the parameters and call the original function
    Console.WriteLine("TestPlugin DispatchSpawn Post");
    // post code
    return result;
  };
});
```

This example hooks the function and prints a message before the original function is called.

The `next` parameter is a getter of the original function.

Writing code before the call to the original function means it will be executed before the original function, and the same applies to post code.

If you want to cancel the call, you can just not call the original function.

<Callout type="info">
  All hooks will be automatically destroyed when the plugin is unloaded.
</Callout>


### Unhooking the function

You can unhook the function by using `func.RemoveHook` method.
Example:
```csharp
func.RemoveHook(guid);
```

This example removes the hook from the function.
