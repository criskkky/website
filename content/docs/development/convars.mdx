This page introduce various api to interact with game convars. ~It's not fake convar!~

## Creating convar

Here's an example of creating a convar.
```csharp
IConVar<bool> convar = Core.ConVar.Create<bool>("sw_test_cvar", "Help message", true, ConvarFlags.CLIENT_CAN_EXECUTE);
```

Explanation:
- `sw_test_cvar` is the name of the convar.
- `Help message` is the help message of the convar.
- `true` is the default value of the convar.
- `ConvarFlags.CLIENT_CAN_EXECUTE` is the flags of the convar. Can be nullable.

The generic type is the type of the convar, all of the available types are as follows:
- `bool`
- `short`
- `ushort`
- `int`
- `uint`
- `long`
- `ulong`
- `float`
- `double`
- `Color`
- `QAngle`
- `Vector`
- `Vector2D`
- `Vector4D`
- `string`

## Finding convar

Here's an example of finding a convar.
```csharp
IConVar<bool>? convar = Core.ConVar.Find<bool>("sv_cheats");
```

The result is `null` if the convar is not found.
Both created convar and game original convar can be found through this method.

## Various methods on `IConVar<T>`

There are many methods on `IConVar<T>` to interact with the convar. Here, we only introduce the most common ones.

### Setting / Getting values

You can use the property `.Value` to directly get or set the value of the convar.
Example:
```csharp
convar.Value = true;
Console.WriteLine(convar.Value);
```

### Setting value internally

In general, use `.Value` to set value will make your change go into a internal event queue, which means the change won't take effect immediately.
This will become a problem when you are setting it temporarily. (e.g. Modify `sv_autobunnyhopping` in a hook temporarily`.)

To resolve this, we provide method `.SetInternal(T value)` to set the value internally.

Example:
```csharp
convar.SetInternal(true);
```

### Replicate to client

You can replicate a specific value to client with `IConVar<T>` object.

Example:
```csharp
convar.ReplicateToClient(0, true);
```

In the example, 0 means player id, which is your target.

### Query value from client

You can query the value of a convar from a client with `IConVar<T>` object.

Example:
```csharp
convar.QueryClient(0, (value) => {
  Console.WriteLine(value);
});
```

Notice that value's type is string, which means you need to parse it yourself.

### Modifying flags

You have these methods to modify the flags of a convar.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Add flags to the convar.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="flags">flags.</param>
void AddFlags(ConvarFlags flags);

/// <summary>
/// Remove flags from the convar.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="flags">flags.</param>
void RemoveFlags(ConvarFlags flags);

/// <summary>
/// Clear all flags from the convar.
/// </summary>
void ClearFlags();

/// <summary>
/// Get the flags of the convar.
/// </summary>
/// <returns>The flags of the convar.</returns>
ConvarFlags GetFlags();

/// <summary>
/// Check if the convar has the given flags.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="flags">flags.</param>
/// <returns>True if the convar has all the given flags, false otherwise.</returns>
bool HasFlags(ConvarFlags flags);
```

Example call:
```csharp
convar.AddFlags(ConvarFlags.CLIENT_CAN_EXECUTE | ConvarFlags.CHEAT);
```
