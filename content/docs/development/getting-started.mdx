  <Pre className='px-4'>
    {"dotnet new install SwiftlyS2.CS2.PluginTemplate"}
  </Pre>
</CodeBlock>

  <Folder name="build" />
  <Folder name="examples">
    <File name="Commands.example.cs" />
    <File name="Events.example.cs" />

## Publishing
Use the following command to build a publish version of the plugin.
```bash
dotnet publish
```
If it's built successfully, you will find the published package in `build/publish` directory.
You can directly copy the package to the SwiftlyS2's plugin directory for test, and use the .zip file for release.
