---

## Prerequisites
To start develop on SwiftlyS2, you will need the following prerequisites:
- .NET 8.0 SDK

## Install package
After you have installed the .NET 8.0 SDK and ensure that `dotnet` command is in your PATH, you can install the SwiftlyS2 package using the following command:
<CodeBlock>
  <Pre className='px-4'>
    {"dotnet new install SwiftlyS2.CS2.PluginTemplate"}
  </Pre>
</CodeBlock>

## Create a plugin from template
Use the following command to create a plugin from the template.
Fill in the information as you want, and run the generated command.

<DotnetTemplateGenerator/>

After it's properly generated, the folder structure should looks like this:
<Files>
  <Folder name="build" />
  <Folder name="examples">
    <File name="Commands.example.cs" />
    <File name="Events.example.cs" />
    <File name="GameEvents.example.cs" />
    <File name="HookAndCallNativeFunctions.example.cs" />
    <File name="NetMessage.example.cs" />
    <File name="SoundEvent.example.cs" />
  </Folder>
  <Folder name="src">
    <File name="PluginClassName.cs" />
  </Folder>
  <File name="manifest.json" />
  <File name="README.md" />
  <File name="PluginId.csproj" />
</Files>


## Update version
The package version in template might not be the latest version.
Update the following line to update it.
<VersionGetter/>

## About manifest.json
The manifest.json file is used to define the plugin's metadata, including plugin id, author, description and etc.
By default, template will automatically ship the manifest.json in published package, which is necessary for the plugin to be loaded by SwiftlyS2.

## Publishing
Use the following command to build a publish version of the plugin.
```bash
dotnet publish
```
If it's built successfully, you will find the published package in `build/publish` directory.
You can directly copy the package to the SwiftlyS2's plugin directory for test, and use the .zip file for release.

## Explore
To explore the API reference, you can check the `examples` folder in the template, which contains some examples of a few features.
You can also check the following pages for more detailed API documentation.
