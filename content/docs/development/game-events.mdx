<Callout type="warning">
  Technically, game events are already a deprecated feature in Source 2. Many of the game events are currently not working.
</Callout>

## Fire a game event

Example:
```csharp
Core.GameEvent.Fire<EventShowSurvivalRespawnStatus>(@event => {
  @event.LocToken = "test";
});
```

This example fires an `EventShowSurvivalRespawnStatus` event to all players, and sets the `LocToken` property.

You can also use `FireToPlayer` to fire an event to a specific player.

<Callout type="warning">
  The `@event` param is a temporary object that **must not** be used outside the configure lambda expression.
</Callout>

## Hook a game event

There are two ways to hook a game event:

<Tabs items={['With method', 'With attribute']} defaultIndex={0}>
  <Tab value="With method">
  ```csharp
  Core.GameEvent.HookPre<EventShowSurvivalRespawnStatus>(@event => {
    Console.WriteLine("EventShowSurvivalRespawnStatus is fired");
    return HookResult.Continue;
  });
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="With attribute">
  ```csharp
  [GameEventHandler(HookMode.Pre)]
  public HookResult TestGameEventHandler(EventShowSurvivalRespawnStatus @event) {
    Console.WriteLine("EventShowSurvivalRespawnStatus is fired");
    return HookResult.Continue;
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This example hooks an `EventShowSurvivalRespawnStatus` event, and prints a message.

You can also use `HookPost` to hook a game event after it's fired.

<Callout type="warning">
  The `@event` param is a temporary object that only exists in the current tick.
  If you want to use it after the current tick, you need to copy the value to a new object first.
</Callout>
