Various information about entity and entity system.

## Entity

An entity is a game object, which can be created or removed.

## Create an entity

Example:
```csharp
var entity = Core.EntitySystem.CreateEntity<CPointWorldText>();
```
This example creates a `point_worldtext` entity with class `CPointWorldText`.
You can also use `CreateEntityByDesignerName` to create an entity by specifying the designer name.

## Get existing entities

You can use methods in entity system to get existing entities.

<Callout type="warning">
  The methods that return multiple entities return an `IEnumerable<T>` type.
  It's recommended to use Linq to query entities, to avoid too much iteration.
</Callout>

### Get all entities
Example:
```csharp
var entities = Core.EntitySystem.GetAllEntities();
```

### Get entities by class

Example:

```csharp
var entities = Core.EntitySystem.GetEntityByClass<CPointWorldText>();
```

## Entity Handle

Entity Handle is a handle to a game entity, which is also a unique identifier for an entity.
<Callout type="info">
  It consists of two parts:
  - Entity Index (15 bit)
  - Serial Number (17 bit)

  Combined together, it is a uint32.
</Callout>

### Get entity by handle

```csharp
var entity = handle.Value;
```
The result will be null if the entity is invalid.

### Get handle by entity

```csharp
var handle = Core.EntitySystem.GetRefEHandle(entity);
```
