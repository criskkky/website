## What are sound events

Sound events are the game's sound system interface that allows you to programmatically emit sounds to players. You can play weapon sounds, ambient sounds, or any sound defined in the game's sound event system.

## Creating and emitting a sound event

Here's a basic example of creating and emitting a sound event:

```csharp
using var soundEvent = new SoundEvent() {
  Name = "Weapon_AK47.Single",
};

// Add recipients
soundEvent.Recipients.AddAllPlayers();

// Emit the sound
soundEvent.Emit();
```

This example will emit the AK47 shooting sound to all players in the server.

<Callout type="info">
  The `using` keyword is used to dispose the sound event when it's not used anymore, which helps prevent memory leaks.
</Callout>

## Configuring sound properties

You can configure various properties of a sound event to control how it sounds:

### Name

The name of the sound event. This should match a sound event defined in the game's sound system.

```csharp
soundEvent.Name = "Weapon_AK47.Single";
```

### Volume

Controls the volume of the sound. Default is `1.0f`, range is typically `0.0f` to `1.0f`.

```csharp
soundEvent.Volume = 0.5f; // 50% volume
```

### Pitch

Controls the pitch of the sound. Default is `1.0f`. Higher values increase pitch, lower values decrease it.

```csharp
soundEvent.Pitch = 2.0f; // Double the pitch
```

### Source Entity

You can set the entity from which the sound originates. Use the entity's index, or set to `-1` to emit at the recipient's location.

```csharp
soundEvent.SourceEntityIndex = entity.Index; // From a specific entity
// or
soundEvent.SourceEntityIndex = -1; // At recipient location (default)
```

You can also use the helper method:

```csharp
soundEvent.SetSourceEntity(entity);
```

## Advanced configuration

Sound events support additional parameters through setter methods:

### Setting position

You can set a 3D position for the sound:

```csharp
soundEvent.SetFloat3("public.position", 100.0f, 200.0f, 300.0f);
// or using a Vector
soundEvent.SetFloat3("public.position", position);
```

### Setting other parameters

You can set various data types on sound events:

```csharp
soundEvent.SetBool("field_name", true);
soundEvent.SetInt32("field_name", 42);
soundEvent.SetUInt32("field_name", 100u);
soundEvent.SetFloat("field_name", 1.5f);
```

## Recipients

Recipients determine which players will hear the sound event. You must add at least one recipient before emitting the sound.

### Add all players

```csharp
soundEvent.Recipients.AddAllPlayers();
```

### Add specific player

```csharp
soundEvent.Recipients.AddPlayer(playerid);
```

### Add multiple players

```csharp
soundEvent.Recipients.AddPlayer(playerid1);
soundEvent.Recipients.AddPlayer(playerid2);
```

## Complete example

Here's a complete example combining all the features:

```csharp
public void PlayCustomSound(CCSPlayerController player) {
  using var soundEvent = new SoundEvent() {
    // Set the sound event name
    Name = "Weapon_AK47.Single",
    
    // Set the source entity to the player
    SourceEntityIndex = player.Pawn.Value!.Index,
    
    // Control volume and pitch
    Volume = 0.5f,
    Pitch = 2.0f
  };

  // Set additional parameters
  soundEvent.SetFloat3("public.position", 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);

  // Add recipients
  soundEvent.Recipients.AddAllPlayers();

  // Emit the sound event
  soundEvent.Emit();
}
```
