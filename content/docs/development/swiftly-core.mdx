title: Swiftly Core
---

This page introduce the concept of `ISwiftlyCore` and its services.

`ISwiftlyCore` is the central singleton object in the swiftlys2 plugin framework, which is injected through BasePlugin constructor.
It provides access to all essential services, including:

- Game services
- Logger
- Configuration
- And more

As a singleton, `ISwiftlyCore` naturally manages the plugin lifecycle, enabling seamless hot reload functionality.

Best Practice: Use dependency injection to share this object across your services.

Note: In the following sections, the variable `Core` refers to the ISwiftlyCore instance by default.

The interface definition of ISwiftlyCore is as follows:
